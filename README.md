Microsoft azure services used : Azure web apps.



Descripton of the azure service : Web Apps are one of the most widely used Azure service that enables us to host our web applications in Azure. It can host a User Interactive application or even a backend service like a WCF Service or Web APIs. With Web Apps, we can leverage the power of Microsoft Azure and build a multi-functional, immensely scalable, highly secured and seamlessly accessible internet or intranet-based applications.Features of Web Apps
Auto Scale
Azure promises 99.95% availability in its SLA for web apps. In order to have seam less experience for the users even in high demand, we can scale out or scale up the web apps instances to support load. We can also configure auto scale to web apps based on some metrics like CPU percentage, RAM Utilization etc.

Easy Deployments
With Web apps, we can make use of DevOps feature and we can deploy our applications directly from source code repository like Visual studio Team Services, Git Hub Bitbucket etc.

Language Choice
Web apps support applications built on many languages and framework like ASP.Net, .Net Core, Java,PHP, Python and Node.js.

Security
We can integrate user identity provider services and enhance the capability of web applications. For example, we can use Azure AD to maintain user database, authenticated login and authorization.
